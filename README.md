This is a Photoshop UXP plugin that connects ComfyUI with Photoshop to generate pictures.

**Usage**
1. Install the plugin in Photoshop using UXP Developer Tools or by copying this folder to the plugin directory.
2. Open the panel named **绘影·AICG** from the Plugins menu.

Opening `index.html` directly in a browser will not work because the code relies on UXP runtime APIs.
